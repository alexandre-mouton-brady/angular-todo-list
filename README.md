# Angular Todo List

## Intro

This project is part of a serie. I've been asked to learn Angular and thought the best way to do so is by creating real world application. They are probably far from being optimal but the goal is to learn the technology and see what it has to offer. Every time I finish an app (or I get tired of it which happens too, let's be honest), I go through the same process. I go on dribbble / behance, search for nice UI that wouldn't be too hard to recreate (design AND features wise) and proceed to make it happen. I always credit the author and link their work.

## About this app

This app is the famous to-do list app that most new commers to a technology decide to make. It doesn't do much.

* You can add a todo
* Mark a todo as done
* Delete a todo

I also implemented presistant data with local storage.

## Credits

This app is inspired by the work of [Anna Supronenko](https://www.behance.net/gallery/41406421/Daily-UI-Challenge)'s take on the Daily UI challenge. Don't hesistate to check her work out on Behance.

Most of the icons come from [https://materialdesignicons.com/](https://materialdesignicons.com/).

## Notes

* Responsive is kind of off. It wasn't really the goal here
* Lots of "buttons" have no effets and only there for design purpose
* Semantic is trash, Angular is weird I'd say
* I didn't implement the footer of the design
* Probably a few other stuff like test cases such as empty todos and stuff
